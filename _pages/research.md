## Relative Clause Attachment and Prosodic Phrasing in Akan Twi and English (2024)

- **Abstract**:
  This thesis investigates relative clause attachment preferences and prosodic cues in Akan Twi, a Niger-Congo language spoken primarily in Ghana. Drawing upon insights from theoretical linguistics, psycholinguistics, and phonology, the study employs a multifaceted approach to elucidate the mechanisms underlying attachment preferences and explore the role of prosody in guiding language comprehension. Through a combination of literature review, theoretical analysis, and empirical investigation, the research aims to expound on the factors influencing relative clause processing in Akan Twi. Participants' preferences for attaching relative clauses are examined through a sentence completion task, and prosodic features are analyzed in a production experiment to uncover their role in guiding attachment decisions. The findings of the study reveal a preference for low attachment contrary to initial expectations influenced by the  Implicit Prosody Hypothesis (Fodor, 1998, 2002). Prosodic events such as pauses and pitch resets, while not overtly indicative of attachment type, provide insights into the interaction between implicit attachment preferences and explicit prosody. The analysis of prosodic cues suggests that while certain patterns may influence attachment decisions, there is variability in their usage across speakers. This research contributes to our understanding of syntactic processing in tonal languages and explicates the relationship between prosody, syntax, and attachment preferences in Akan Twi.

## Pronouns and Stereotypes: Do Implicit Biases and thus Processing Costs of Gender Information Change with Gender Stereotypes? (2023)

- **Abstract**:
  Several studies on gender stereotypes and processing have noted that gender information is one of
the features implicitly and automatically activated upon encounter of nouns that are either marked for
gender or marked by a stereotype. There is therefore a cost in processing, that is the mismatch cost, when
the stereotyped noun is not referred to by a gender-matching pronoun. Gender stereotypes, as well as
societal takes on gender roles, have undergone lots of change. Using materials from Kennison and Trofe
(2003), this paper investigates what these changes mean for processing, when the previously strongly
stereotyped nouns are encountered and referred to with the binary pronouns he/she and the non-binary
singular-they, the latter which is rarely acceptable with referential antecedents. The results indicate that
gender information is still activated with lexical information, and stereotypes continue to have an effect
on processing. Changes in these stereotypes have not caused an amelioration of the mismatch effect, and
singular-they with referential antecedents remains fairly unacceptable.
