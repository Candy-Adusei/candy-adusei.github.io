# Pronouns and Stereotypes: Do Implicit Biases and thus Processing Costs of Gender Information Change with Gender Stereotypes? (2023)

- **Abstract**:
  Several studies on gender stereotypes and processing have noted that gender information is one of
the features implicitly and automatically activated upon encounter of nouns that are either marked for
gender or marked by a stereotype. There is therefore a cost in processing, that is the mismatch cost, when
the stereotyped noun is not referred to by a gender-matching pronoun. Gender stereotypes, as well as
societal takes on gender roles, have undergone lots of change. Using materials from Kennison and Trofe
(2003), this paper investigates what these changes mean for processing, when the previously strongly
stereotyped nouns are encountered and referred to with the binary pronouns he/she and the non-binary
singular-they, the latter which is rarely acceptable with referential antecedents. The results indicate that
gender information is still activated with lexical information, and stereotypes continue to have an effect
on processing. Changes in these stereotypes have not caused an amelioration of the mismatch effect, and
singular-they with referential antecedents remains fairly unacceptable.
