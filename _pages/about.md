I am Candy Adusei,a psycholinguist and PhD researcher at the Institute of Linguistics (IFLA), University of Stuttgart. My research explores sentence processing, prosody, and cognitive modeling, with a focus on language structure and  comprehension in Akan Twi.

With a background in English Linguistics, Political Science, and project-based educational innovation, I integrate eye-tracking and experimental methods to investigate how languages are processed across structures and contexts.
