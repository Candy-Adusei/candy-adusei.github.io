Hi, I'm Candy Adusei

I'm a linguist and psycholinguistics researcher exploring how speakers of **Akan Twi** interpret ambiguous relative clauses, and attachment preferences in complex sentences.

I'm currently preparing a PhD dissertation and experiments at the intersection of **language processing**, **syntax**, and **cognitive science**.
