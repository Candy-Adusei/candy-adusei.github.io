At this Research Colloquium, I will be presenting my work on sentence processing in Akan Twi, sharing findings from my MA thesis on relative clause attachment and prosodic phrasing, and outlining the next phase of my doctoral research, focusing on the role of implicit causality in ambiguity resolution, in the footsteps of Rohde et al.(2011).
