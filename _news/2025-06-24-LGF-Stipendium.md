I am excited to share that I have been awarded the LGF Stuttgart Stipendium (Landesgraduiertenförderung Baden-Württemberg) to fund my PhD research for the next four years at the Institute of Linguistics (IFLA), University of Stuttgart.

The LGF is a highly competitive doctoral scholarship awarded by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Württemberg to support outstanding early career researchers across disciplines.

Receiving this scholarship is a deeply encouraging milestone. I am grateful to my mentors, colleagues, and community who have supported this journey, and I look forward to sharing updates as this next chapter of research unfolds.
