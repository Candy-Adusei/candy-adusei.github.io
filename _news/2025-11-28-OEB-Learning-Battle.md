Excited to announce that I won the  [OEB Learning Battle in 2024](https://oeb.global/oeb-media), sharing the stage with renowned learning innovator Inge de Waard at the OEB Conference in Berlin. 
The OEB Learning Battle challenges participants to design and present innovative, learner-centered solutions that address current challenges in education and training.
Standing alongside Inge was an incredible honor, and bringing the trophy home was a moment of gratitude for the mentors, students, and communities who inspire this work.

This win is not just a personal milestone but a reminder of the importance of research-driven, inclusive, and culturally aware learning innovations in shaping equitable educational futures.

Thank you to everyone who supported this journey, and to OEB for providing a platform where learning professionals can challenge, inspire, and transform the future of education.
