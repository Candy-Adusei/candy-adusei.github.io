I am honored to share that I have been selected as one of the OEB 30 Under 30 â€“ Top Learning Professionals and Change-Makers for 2024.

The OEB (Online Educa Berlin) 30 Under 30 recognizes young professionals around the world who are shaping the future of learning and education through innovation, commitment, and impactful projects. 

This recognition acknowledges my initiatives supporting first-generation and international students, and my commitment to accessible, learner-centered academic environments.

As part of the OEB 30 Under 30 cohort, I will join a network of emerging leaders in education technology and learning design, contributing to conversations on inclusive learning futures, AI in education, and community-driven innovation.

Thank you to the mentors, students, and colleagues who continue to inspire this work.
